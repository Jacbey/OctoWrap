# OctoWrap

OctoWrap is literally just an electron wrapper around the web app.

## Installation

Download from releases and use the installer

## Usage

Run installer, OctoWrap will automatically open.

The default IP is `octoprint.local`, to change the IP right click the tray icon and change there.

Closing the OctoPrint window hides it to tray.  Right click tray icon to open again.

## Why

- I needed to get back into Electron dev, this was a good way to get my head round it again.
- I don't use Chrome so can't easily create wrappers like Chrome enables.
- Kept ending up with 10 OctoPrint tabs open at a time.  This is much nicer ðŸ¤—
